                    When you choose for your child to start at Panda Playgroup, you will be invited to come in for two
                    settling-in visits. Each visit will last around an hour. There is no cost for attending settling-in
                    visits, and they should be arranged in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of our children are allocated a key worker, who is responsible for working closely with you to
                    help settle your child into Panda Playgroup. They also have a longer-term responsibility to provide
                    the best learning outcomes for your child, communicate your child&apos;s progress with you and
                    maintain a dedicated learning journal. This learning journal provides a record of your child&apos;s
                    interests and development, using photos, comments and artwork.
