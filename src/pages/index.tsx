                    Our aim is to provide your child with the best support and care as they take their first steps
                    towards starting school. Our sessions provide local pre-school children with an exciting journey of
                    learning through play.

                    We have been serving the Copmanthorpe community for more than forty years. Generations of little
                    Pandas have started their life journey in our caring and capable hands!

                    toddlers, <strong>Sticky Mitts and Tiny Tots</strong>! This is a friendly, fun group for children
                    and their grown-ups happening regularly during term time.
