                    At Panda Playgroup we believe we have a responsibility to protect this planet for our children. We
                    have excellent recycling facilities on our doorstep (see below), and we encourage our children to
                    learn about recycling. We are also doing our best to reduce our plastic use, and are a glitter-free
                    setting.

                    At Howell Hall we have access to the Copmanthorpe Community Garden which is maintained mostly by{" "}
                    <strong>Sprouts</strong>, a group of local, green fingered, grow-your-own enthusiasts. We say
                    &ldquo;mostly&rdquo; because the Panda children have a bed of their own to grow fruit and veg all
                    year round, giving them the chance to learn about how food grows, whilst getting covered in mud
                    (we&apos;re not sorry).

                    Recycling
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Pandas is very lucky to have a Parish Council supported recycling collection point right outside. A
                    group of wonderful village volunteers collect the recycling on a regular basis and take it to{" "}
                    <a href="https://stnicks.org.uk/">St Nicks</a> in York - from there it is passed on to{" "}
                    <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-GB">TerraCycle</a>. St Nicks are able to raise funds through
                    their recycling scheme, which contributes towards their running costs.

                <p className="mb-0">These are the items that can be recycled here:</p>
